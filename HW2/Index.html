			<p> I grew up in Central Kenya, in a small town called Maragua. I went to elementary and Secondary school near the town. After high school, I joined an accounting college in the Nairobi. I worked for a couple of years as an accountant then emigrated to USA in 2004. During my earlier years, I loved playing soccer with my brothers and friends, we participated in youth soccer in the district. I played soccer after high school as a goal keeper in locally organized league. I was active in athletics in high school, I run mostly 800M, 1500M and 5000M races. I also participated in long jump and triple jump. I still hold the district record in triple jump, which I set during District Athletics Meeting in my senior year.</P>
			
			<p> After moving to Iowa City, I was blessed with two daughters aged 9 and 6. I attended Kirkwood Community College for my AA degree.I am a student at University of Iowa studying Finance and MIS graduating in December 2012.  I hope to work in Finance or Accounting after I graduate. </p>
	
			<p> I have been back to Kenya four times since 2004 to see my family. My parents, brothers and sisters live in Kenya </p>
			<p> I'm big soccer fan, especially English premier league. My team is Manchester United "Go Red Devils". I love watching sports, all kinds of sports.	</p>
